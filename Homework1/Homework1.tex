\begin{homeworkProblem}
	True or False: The statements \emph{``If Earl studied, then Earl received an A.''} and \emph{``If Earl received an A, then Earl studied.''} are logically equivalent.
	
	\subsection{\textbf{Solution}}
	\textbf{False}\\
	Here, the two statements are converses of each other, which are not logically equivalent.\\~\\
	For instance, consider the situation where Earl got an A but did not study. In this instance, the original statement is true because Earl did not satisfy the hypothesis. However, the second statement would be false because Earl got an A without studying. Thus, the two statements are not logically equivalent.
\end{homeworkProblem}
\begin{homeworkProblem}
	True or False: The statements \emph{``If Earl studied, then Earl received an A.''} and \emph{``If Earl did not
receive an A, the Earl did not study.''} are logically equivalent.
	\subsection{\textbf{Solution}}
	\textbf{True}\\%
	Here, the two statements are contrapositives of each other, which are logically equivalent.\\~\\
	Let \(p\) be the proposition \emph{``Earl studied''} and \(q\) be the proposition \emph{``Earl recieved an A.''}. Note that the first statement given in the problem can be rewritten using the above statements as \(p{\rightarrow}q\), and the second statement given in the problem as \({\neg}q{\rightarrow}{\neg}p\). The truth table for each statement given in the problem is the following:
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{|c c|c|c|}
% |c c|c| means that there are three columns in the table and
% a vertical bar ’|’ will be printed on the left and right borders,
% and between the second and the third columns.
% The letter ’c’ means the value will be centered within the column,
% letter ’l’, left-aligned, and ’r’, right-aligned.
p & q & p \rightarrow q & {\neg}q {\rightarrow} {\neg} p\\ % Use & to separate the columns
\hline % Put a horizontal line between the table header and the rest.
T & T & T & T\\
T & F & F & F\\
F & T & T & T\\
F & F & T & T\\
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}
Since \({\neg}q{\rightarrow}{\neg}p{\:}{\equiv}{\:}p{\rightarrow}q\), the statements \emph{``If Earl studied, then Earl received an A.''} and \emph{``If Earl did not
receive an A, the Earl did not study.''} are logically equivalent.
\end{homeworkProblem}
\begin{homeworkProblem}
Write the negation of the statement \emph{``If Earl studied, then Earl received an A.''}
\subsection{\textbf{Solution}}
	\textbf{\emph{Earl studied and did not receive an A}}\\~\\
Let \(p\) be the proposition \emph{``Earl studied''} and \(q\) be the proposition \emph{``Earl recieved an A.''} Note that \({\neg}(p{\rightarrow}q){\:}{\equiv}{\:}p{\land}{\neg}q\). Thus we can write the negation of \emph{``If Earl studied, then Earl received an A.''} as \emph{``Earl studied and did not receive an A''}.
\end{homeworkProblem}
\begin{homeworkProblem}
Write the converse, inverse, and contrapositive of the statement \emph{``If Popeye is a Dachshund, then Popeye has short legs.''}
\subsection{\textbf{Solution}}
\textbf{Converse: \emph{``If Popeye has short legs, then Popeye is a Dachshund''}}\\
\textbf{Inverse: \emph{``If Popeye is not a Dachshund, then Popeye does not have short legs''}}\\
\textbf{Contrapositive: \emph{``If Popeye does not have short legs, then Popeye is not a Dachshund''}}\\~\\
Let \(p\) be the proposition \emph{``Popeye is a Dachshund''} and \(q\) be the proposition \emph{``Popeye has short legs''}. Note that the converse of \(p{\rightarrow}q\) is defined as \(q{\rightarrow}p\), the inverse of \(p{\rightarrow}q\) is defined as \({\neg}p{\rightarrow}{\neg}q\), and the contrapositive of \(p{\rightarrow}q\) is defined as \({\neg}q{\rightarrow}{\neg}p\). Thus, the converse of the original statement is \emph{``If Popeye has short legs, then Popeye is a Dachshund,''} the inverse of the original statement is \emph{``If Popeye is not a Dachshund, then Popeye does not have short legs,''} and the contrapositive of the original statement is \emph{``If Popeye does not have short legs, then Popeye is not a Dachshund.''}
\end{homeworkProblem}
\begin{homeworkProblem}
Use a truth table to determine whether \((p{\land}{\neg}q){\rightarrow}r{\:}{\equiv}{\:}p{\rightarrow}(q{\lor}r)\).
\subsection{\textbf{Solution}}
\textbf{True}\\~\\
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{|c c c|c|c|c|c|}
% |c c|c| means that there are three columns in the table and
% a vertical bar ’|’ will be printed on the left and right borders,
% and between the second and the third columns.
% The letter ’c’ means the value will be centered within the column,
% letter ’l’, left-aligned, and ’r’, right-aligned.
p & q & r & p{\land}{\neg}q & (p{\land}{\neg}q){\rightarrow}r & q{\lor}r &  p{\rightarrow}(q{\lor}r)\\
\hline
T & T & T & F & T & T & T\\
T & T & F & F & T & T & T\\
T & F & T & T & T & T & T\\
T & F & F & T & F & F & F\\
F & T & T & F & T & T & T\\
F & T & F & F & T & T & T\\
F & F & T & F & T & T & T\\
F & F & F & F & T & F & T\\
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}
In the above, since column \((p{\land}{\neg}q){\rightarrow}r\) and \(p{\rightarrow}(q{\lor}r)\) have matching corresponding elements, \((p{\land}{\neg}q){\rightarrow}r{\:}{\equiv}{\:}p{\rightarrow}(q{\lor}r)\). Without building the truth table, this can still be justified.\\
Note that \(p{\land}{\neg}q\) can only be true when \(p\) is true and \(q\) is false, which means that the statement \((p{\land}{\neg}q){\rightarrow}r\) can only be false when \(p\) is true, \(q\) is false, and \(r\) is false (which gives the implication \(T{\rightarrow}F\) which is logically equivalent to \(F\)). Using similar reasoning, since \(a{\rightarrow}b\) is only false when \(a\) is true and \(b\) is false, \(p{\rightarrow}(q{\land}r)\) is false when p is true and \(q{\land}r)\) is false, which is only true where \(q\) and \(r\) are both false. Thus, since they are both only false where \(p\) is true and both \(q\) and \(r\) are false and true otherwise, the two statements must be logically equivalent.

\begin{homeworkProblem}
Write the negation of the statement \emph{``The bulb in my lamp is burned out or my lamp is not plugged in."} What is the name of the logical equivalence that you applied?
\subsection{\textbf{Solution}}
\textbf{\emph{``The bulb in my lamp is not burned out and my lamp is plugged in''}}\\~\\
Let \(p\) be the proposition \emph{``The bulb in my lamp is burned out''} and \(q\) be the proposition \emph{``My lamp is plugged in.''} The original statement can thus be written as \(p{\lor}{\neg}q\). The negation of this statement can be symbolically denoted as \({\neg}(p{\lor}{\neg}q)\) which by De Morgan's law is equivalent to \({\neg}p{\land}{\neg}({\neg}q)\) which by the double negation law is equivalent to \({\neg}p{\land}q\). Putting it back into words, the negation of the original statement is \emph{``The bulb in my lamp is not burned out and my lamp is plugged in.''}
